      <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device using SwiftData:</p>

          <li>Bookmarked questions</li>
          <li>Progress statistics and accuracy metrics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p><strong>Advertising (Free Tier)</strong></p>
      <p>The free version of the App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use data such as device
